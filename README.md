Create React components effortlessly with React Component Generator! This open-source package offers a command-line interface (CLI) for generating React components, making it easier and faster to kickstart your React projects. While it's the initial release and there is a lot more you can add to enhance your component generator, such as different component templates, TypeScript support, styling options, tests, and more. This tool is designed to simplify component creation and boost your productivity as you contribute to the React community.

# Why React Composer?

* Rapidly generate functional or class components with a single command.
* Simple and intuitive CLI for component generation.
* Customizable component templates for future expansions.
* Saves you valuable time by automating the boilerplate code.
* A perfect companion for your React projects.
